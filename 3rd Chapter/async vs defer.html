  <title>ASYNC VS DEFER</title>
<!---
When adding a JavaScript file to an HTML document, you can use the "async" and "defer" attributes to control how the script is loaded and executed.
In summary, async loads and executes scripts as soon as possible, while defer loads scripts asynchronously but executes them only after the HTML document has been fully parsed(read).
---> 
<!---
Async:
- The async attribute tells the browser to load the script asynchronously, meaning it will not block the parsing(reading) of the HTML document.
- The script will be executed as soon as it's loaded, without waiting for other scripts or HTML elements to be parsed.
- If multiple scripts have the async" attribute, their execution order is not guaranteed.
---> 
  <script src="/javascript_file.js" async></script>
  
<!---
Defer:
- The defer attribute tells the browser to load the script asynchronously, but execute it only after the HTML document has been fully parsed.
- The script will be executed in the order it appears in the HTML document, after all other scripts and HTML elements have been parsed.
- If multiple scripts have the defer attribute, their execution order is guaranteed to be the same as their order in the HTML document.

  <script src="/javascript_file.js" defer></script>
